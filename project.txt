PESEL YYMMDDLLLLC
YY - two last digits of year YYYY
MM - two digits of month
DD - two digits of day
L - order number, with sex indication
C - control number

To recognize different years of birth (ex. 1899, 1999) we add some number to month number
    for years 1800 - 1899 - 80
    for years 1900 - 1999 - 0
    for years 2000 - 2099 - 20
    for years 2100 - 2199 - 40
    for years 2200 - 2299 - 60

Control number is calculated by modulo operations.
Each number in PESEL has it's wage, respecitvely: 1 3 7 9 1 3 7 9 1 3
We multiply each number by it's wage, add it together, we get x1
Now x1 mod 10 = x2
Next we substract x2 from 10 (10 - x2) and get x3
At the end C = x3 mod 10

10'th digit, it is the last L, is even for womens, and uneven for mens.

For each day, we can have 10'000 combinations of PESELs.
Half for men, and half for womens.
