PESEL YYMMDDLLLLC
YY - two last digits of year YYYY
MM - two digits of month
DD - two digits of day
L - order number, with sex indication
C - control number

To recognize different years of birth (ex. 1899, 1999) we add some number to month number
    for years 1800 - 1899 - 80
    for years 1900 - 1999 - 0
    for years 2000 - 2099 - 20
    for years 2100 - 2199 - 40
    for years 2200 - 2299 - 60

Control number is calculated by modulo operations.
Each number in PESEL has it's wage, respecitvely: 1 3 7 9 1 3 7 9 1 3
We multiply each number by it's wage, add it together, we get x1
Now x1 mod 10 = x2
Next we substract x2 from 10 (10 - x2) and get x3
At the end C = x3 mod 10

10'th digit, it is the last L, is even for womens, and uneven for mens.

For each day, we can have 10'000 combinations of PESELs.
Half for men, and half for womens.

Generation process:
Give birth date: YYYY MM DD
Choose sex: Male/Female
Choose one of 5'000 generated combinations!

NAME
pesel-utils - a program for checking and generating PESEL numbers.
PESEL is a Polish citizien's ID number regulated by law.
It is widely used in Poland.

SYNOPSIS
pesel-utils [options]

OPTIONS
-c --check [-[pods]] - checks given arguments.
-g --generate [-[dso][-a]] - generates PESEL number based on given values.
-c and -g can't be used together. 
-d --date [YYYY,M[M],D[D]] - loads date into program.
-s --gender [[f/m/female/male]] - loads gender into program.
-o --ordinals [NNNN] - loads 4-digit number called 'ordinals' into program.
-p --pesel [NNNNNNNNNNN] - loads 11-digit PESEL number into program.
-a --all - used with option -g tells it to generate all possible PESEL numbers.

DESCRIPTION
Pesel-utils program has two modes: checking and generating.

It can check if a date (-d) or ordinals number (-o) fits pesel standard,
if a gender (-s) is one of "f", "female", "m", "male" 
(letter case doesn't matter) and if PESEL number (-p) is valid. 
The program can check every argument type at once, but every type must 
appear only once. So it can't check two dates at one invocation, 
for example. When checking PESEL program prints out it's details:
born date and gender.

The generating mode takes at least two arguments needed to make a 
PESEL number, so obligatory date (-d) and at least one of gender (-s)
or ordinals (-s). If the program is given gender and ordinals they
must suit to each other. It can olso generate all possible PESELs for
given data with all (-a) option which can't be set when ordinals (-o)
are given.

EXAMPLES
pesel-utils -g -d 1997,4,22 -s f - Generates PESEL for female born on 22 April 1997.
pesel-utils -g -s MALE -d 2000,02,01 - Generates PESEL for male born on 1st February 2000.
pesel-utils --generate --gender MALE --date 2000,02,01 - The same as previous.
pesel-utils -c -p 97042226664 - Checks given PESEL.
pesel-utils --check -d 1888,09,12 -p 00220193470 - Checks firstly date and then PESEL.
pesel-utils -c -o 9999 - Checks ordinals number.
